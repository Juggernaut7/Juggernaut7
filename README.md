### 👋 Hi there, I’m @Juggernaut7

I'm **Abdulkabir**, a passionate and curious full-stack developer, UI/UX designer, and tech enthusiast from west africa. I love turning ideas into clean, scalable, and impactful digital products.

- UI/UX design and user-centered development
- Open source collaboration and documentation

### 💻 My current project:
🔥 **DevPath** – A powerful developer blogging and learning platform  
> Features include: user-auth, rich text editor, interactive code playground, AI-powered help, community discussions, and more.  
> Tech Stack: MERN, Vanilla CSS (for now), moving into advanced tooling gradually.
